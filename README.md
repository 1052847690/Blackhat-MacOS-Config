# MacOS Maid
A simple shell script to get your Macbook ready for Blackhat (or everyday life).

## What It Does:
- Prompt For Password If Not Root
- Deletes Saved Wireless Networks
- Installs Needed System Updates
- Turns On Full Disk Encryption
- Turns On Firewall

## Usage:
- Review for your preferences and comment out options **You** dont want.
- Set `homessid` and `workssid` variable to stop from deleting those!
- `chmod +x maid.sh`
- `./maid.sh`

## Important Notice
I likely don't know what I am doing and this could be done faster, better and simpler some other way. These scripts could also break your MacBook and make you cry.
